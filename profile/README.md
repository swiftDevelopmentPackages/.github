Swift Development Packages by erenkabakci

Over the course of our development cycles we end up writing, using, rewriting and again reusing some code pieces. While some of them are meant to be short-lived, some others change rarely since their core functionality was previously tested, shipped and justified.

Swift Development Packages is a collection of those packages, frameworks, code pieces that are better off being shared and reused.
